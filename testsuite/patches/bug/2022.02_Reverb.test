# Bug 2022.02 observe nondeterministic numbers instrument with reverb
# Symptom: after fixing the "1st note problem" (2022.01), in about 50% of all test runs
#          we still get minor discrepancies about -80db. Comparison of dumped intermediary numbers
#          indicate the discrepancies arise within the Reverb effect.
# Cause: Caused by a combination of several problems, largely due to incomplete Effect::cleanup()
#        - output buffer not cleared on cleanup() -> reverb feeds back values from there
#        - naiive comparison of interpolated float values for the HighPass / LowPass frequency,
#          causing intermittent recalculation of the filter coefficients
#        - read position in the comb filter pipelines not reset on cleanup()
#        - InterpolatedValue not reset on cleanup()
#        - Effect pangain initially set to 0.5 while it should be cos(¼π)
