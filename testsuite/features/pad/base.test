#
# PADSynth: basic test settings
#
# The focus of this test series is on the Spectrum generation of PADSynth.
# Thus we build only one wavetable and play 3 Notes minor sixth upwards, to cover
# at least some relevant probes of this wavetable, since PADSynth starts notes at random phase,
# and sampling upwards will "condense" the wavetable. For context: 128k Wavetable provides 2.6sec
# and 1MiB provides 21.3 sec of unique sound at 48kHz sample rate.
#
# As start we choose a bandwidth to give just some fluctuation
# * Autoscale : automatically stretch/squeeze profile into the defined bandwidth
# * size : stretch/squeeze the profile as a whole (only effective when autoscale = off)
# * expand (="str" in the GUI, modulator.pstretch in code) : add harmonics and change distribution
# * width : size of an individual (sub)Line in the harmonic profile
#
