/** @file Main.cpp
 ** Entry point to the Yoshimi-Testrunner.
 ** Invocation will perform a fixed sequence of actions:
 ** - load default configuration and user defined setup
 ** - parse the command line
 ** - build a complete testsuite definition from the specification directory tree
 ** - perform this testsuite, capturing results
 ** - generate a result report
 ** The [exit code](\ref Stage::getReturnCode) indicates success (0) or failure.
 **
 ** # Guide for Programmers
 ** To understand the basics of the Yoshimi-Testrunner, you might visit the following
 ** - the \ref Config acts as umbrella, since it's directly or indirectly visible everywhere
 ** - we use top-down wiring of dependencies by reference through ctor arguments
 ** - each testcase is assembled and wired by a setup::Mould â€” be sure to look into Mould.cpp
 ** - the suite::step::ExeLauncher manages the running Yoshimi instance, see Scaffolding.hpp
 **
